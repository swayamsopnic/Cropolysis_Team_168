### 🚜 Problem Statement
Design a **sensor-assisted or data-driven system** that recommends the best crops to grow based on:
- Soil nutrients *(N, P, K)*  
- pH value  
- Temperature, humidity, and rainfall  

Additionally, the system should provide **fertilizer guidance** tailored to current conditions, with a focus on **supporting smallholder farmers**.

---

### 🎯 Objectives
- ✅ Recommend suitable crops using soil and environmental data  
- ✅ Provide targeted fertilizer advisory based on nutrient levels  
- ✅ Improve farm productivity through data-driven decisions

### 🌾 Problems Faced by Farmers and Our Solutions

#### 1. ❓ Uncertainty in Crop Selection
- **Problem**: Reliance on traditional knowledge leads to poor yields or crop failure.  
- **Solution**: Our system provides real-time crop recommendations using environmental and soil data.

#### 2. ⚠️ Lack of Soil Nutrient Awareness
- **Problem**: Farmers are unaware of N-P-K levels, leading to inefficient fertilization.  
- **Solution**: Our system analyzes nutrient levels and gives fertilizer suggestions based on data.

#### 3. 📉 Low Productivity Due to Inefficient Practices
- **Problem**: Lack of precision in farming reduces yield and profitability.  
- **Solution**: Data-backed insights empower better planning and execution.

#### 4. 🧓 Over-reliance on Traditional Methods
- **Problem**: Limited accessibility to modern tools results in outdated practices.  
- **Solution**: Our platform is simple and accessible, encouraging scientific farming in rural areas.

#### 5. 🌍 Environmental Degradation
- **Problem**: Overuse or misuse of fertilizers impacts long-term soil and environmental health.  
- **Solution**: Balanced and responsible fertilizer usage is promoted through accurate advisories.
